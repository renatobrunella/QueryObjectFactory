This document is the API specification for the QueryObjectFactory,
version 1.1.0.
<p>QueryObjectFactory is a lightweight runtime JDBC code generator
providing support for CRUD (create, retrieve, update and delete)
operations and stored procedure calls. It is not an object/relational
mapping tool.</p>
<p>Mapping information is defined using Java annotations: {@link
sf.qof.Query}, {@link sf.qof.Insert}, {@link sf.qof.Update}, {@link
sf.qof.Delete} and {@link sf.qof.Call}.</p>
<p><a href="doc-files/mappings.html">Supported mapping options</a></p>
<p>It provides built-in mappers for all Java primitive types and
their boxed versions (int, Integer, etc.) as well as string and date
types. Support for other types can be added at runtime through the use
of adapters ({@link sf.qof.adapter.DynamicMappingAdapter} and {@link 
sf.qof.adapter.GeneratorMappingAdapter})</p>
<p>It can map to Java objects (using getters and setters according
to the Java Bean specification) and supports collections as inputs and
outputs.</p>
<p>It uses <a href="http://cglib.sourceforge.net/">cglib</a>/<a 
href="http://forge.objectweb.org/projects/asm">asm</a> to create 
JDBC wrapper byte-code on the fly.</p>
<p>The static factory {@link sf.qof.QueryObjectFactory} is used to
create query object implementations.</p>
<p>Implementing {@link sf.qof.customizer.Customizer} allows to change
certain parts of the code generation</p>
