   Information to its employees or contractors with a
   need for this access to perform their employment

   EXPRESS OR IMPLIED CONDITIONS, REPRESENTATIONS,
   AND WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF
   MERCHANTABILITY, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, FITNESS FOR

   DISCLAIMERS ARE HELD TO BE LEGALLY INVALID.

   9.0 LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

   9.1 Licensee acknowledges that the Licensed
   Software is experimental. Licensee acknowledges
   that the Licensed Software may have defects or
   deficiencies which cannot or will not be corrected
   by Sun. Licensee will hold Sun harmless from any
   claims based on Licensee's use of the Licensed
   Software for any purposes other than those in

   versions or releases of any Licensed Software
   furnished to Licensee are incompatible with the
   Licensed Software provided to Licensee under this
   Agreement.

   9.2 Licensee shall have the sole responsibility to
   protect adequately and backup Licensee's data
   and/or equipment used in connection with the

   against Sun for lost data, re-run time, inaccurate
   output, work delays or lost profits resulting from
   Licensee' use of the Licensed Software.

   10.0 U.S. GOVERNMENT RIGHTS

   If Licensed Software is being acquired by or on
   behalf of the U.S. Government or by a U.S.
   Government prime contractor or subcontractor (at
   any tier), then the Government's rights in
   Software will be only as set forth in this
   Agreement; this is in accordance with 48 CFR
   227.7201 through 227.7202-4 (for Department of
   Defense (DOD) acquisitions) and with 48 CFR 2.101
   and 12.212 (for non-DOD acquisitions).

   11.0 GENERAL TERMS

   11.1 Any action related to this Agreement will be
   governed by California law and controlling U.S.
   federal law. The U.N. Convention for the
   International Sale of Goods and the choice of law
   rules of any jurisdiction will not apply.

   11.2 Licensed Software and technical data
   delivered under this Agreement are subject to U.S.
   export control laws and may be subject to export
   or import regulations in other countries. Licensee
   agrees to comply strictly with all such laws and
   regulations and acknowledges that it has the
   responsibility to obtain such licenses to export,
   re-export or import as may be required after
   delivery to Licensee.

   11.3 It is understood and agreed that,
   notwithstanding any other provision of this
   Agreement, Licensee's breach of the provisions of
   Section 7 of this Agreement will cause Sun
   irreparable damage for which recovery of money
   damages would be inadequate, and that Sun will
   therefore be entitled to seek timely injunctive
   relief to protect Sun's rights under this
   Agreement in addition to any and all remedies
   available at law.

   11.4 Neither party may assign or otherwise
   transfer any of its rights or obligations under
   this Agreement, without the prior written consent
   of the other party, except that Sun may assign
   this Agreement to an affiliated company.

   11.5 This Agreement is the parties' entire
   agreement relating to its subject matter. It
   supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or
   written communications, proposals, conditions,
   representations and warranties and prevails over
   any conflicting or additional terms of any quote,
   order, acknowledgment, or other communication
   between the parties relating to its subject matter
   during the term of this Agreement. No modification
   to this Agreement will be binding, unless in
   writing and signed by an authorized representative
   of each party.
